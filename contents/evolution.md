### The Development of the Concept of Crypto (Pre-Crypto Era)
**1983:** The concept of eCash (digital currency) was developed by David Chaum (XchangeOn.io, 2023). He intended for users to maintain their anonymity while transferring money online. To ensure digital privacy, he employed cryptographic technology that allowed blind signatures, safeguarding the confidentiality of user transactions (XchangeOn.io, 2023). This was a pivotal moment in the evolution of digital currencies. It laid the foundations for cryptocurrency.

**1998-2008:** After the failure of DigiCash, cryptocurrency was established during this time. B-money (Wei Dai) and Bit gold (Nick Szabo) were presented to decentralize the payment system and virtual currency by means of cryptography (XchangeOn.io, 2023). Although they were never fully developed, their schemes served as the framework needed to establish bitcoin.

The economic crisis faced in 2008 exposed the flaws within the systems of financial institutions. As such, the public sought decentralized options for digital currency, leading Satoshi Nakamoto to publish a paper on Bitcoin as an alternative, ‘Bitcoin- A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System,’ guided by the structures of B-money and Bit gold (XchangeOn.io, 2023).

### The Birth and Establishment of Bitcoin
**2009:** During this year, Satoshi Nakamoto established the presence of Bitcoin to the public, generating the first units of Bitcoin cryptocurrency (Tamplin, T., 2023). As Bitcoin gained attention, its popularity soared as people began to recognize its significance and potential.

**2010:** Vaidya (2024) noted the first Bitcoin transaction made when Laszlo Hanyecz famously offered 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas that cost $41 dollars. The 10,000 BTC used by the programmer has now escalated in value by an estimate of $670 million. The monetary value of Bitcoin was founded when it could be used in place of and swapped for fiat money (government-issued currency).

### Expansion & The Rise of Altcoins
**2011:** This year, the concept of decentralized and encrypted currency cryptocurrency caught on to the public (Crime Stoppers Victoria, n.d.). Several cryptocurrencies based on the structures of Bitcoin emerged, such as Litecoin (created by Charlie Lee), Namecoin, or more commonly referred to as Altcoins (Isieindia., n.d.); They offered faster transactions than Bitcoin.

**2013:** Despite the numerous advantages that Bitcoin presented, it also faced certain limitations. To address these shortcomings, Vitalik Buterin published a paper on Ethereum, a decentralized platform. His vision was to create a blockchain that included an embedded programming language. In such, it enabled developers to build decentralized applications (dapps) on the Ethereum platform.

**2014:** The following year, funds were raised for the development of Ethereum. The fundraising campaign successfully managed to raise over 31,000 Bitcoins (BTC), which amounts to at least $18 million during that time (BEGINNERS, 2024). This led and enabled the construction of the Ethereum platform (decentralized world computer).

### Ethereum and Institutional Interest
**2016:** Cryptocurrencies grew in diversity, exceeding 1,000 unique coins. Ethereum emerged as a transformative platform, introducing smart contracts and enabling Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) as a new fundraising method. The establishment of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance by industry giants like Microsoft and JPMorgan highlighted growing institutional interest in blockchain technology.

### Bitcoin’s Milestone and the ICO Boom
**2017:** Bitcoin hit $10,000, capturing global attention and driving mass adoption. The cryptocurrency market cap surpassed $100 million. An ICO boom resulted in thousands of new tokens, though many were fraudulent. This period marked cryptocurrencies as a serious investment market and attracted diverse participants.

<br><br>
### Market Correction and Regulatory Focus
**2018:** The cryptocurrency market faced a significant downturn, losing over 80% of its total value. This "crypto crash" prompted governments worldwide to intensify regulatory scrutiny. The UK issued a comprehensive report analyzing crypto risks and opportunities, recommending frameworks for consumer protection and market integrity.

<br><br>
### Recovery and Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
**2019:** Cryptocurrencies began to recover, with the market cap reaching $300 billion. DeFi emerged as a groundbreaking innovation, enabling decentralized financial services without intermediaries. Facebook announced its ambitious Libra cryptocurrency project, while major corporations, including Microsoft, launched blockchain services using Ethereum technology.

<br><br>
### Mainstream Adoption and Growth
**2020:** The market cap surpassed $1 trillion for the first time, driven by a 300% surge in Bitcoin’s value during the COVID-19 pandemic. Economic instability pushed investors towards crypto as an alternative. Crypto lending became mainstream, providing new income streams. Paypal integrated cryptocurrency trading, significantly boosting mainstream acceptance.

<br><br>
### Institutional Investments and Legal Milestones
**2021:** The market cap doubled to $2 trillion as companies like Tesla and MicroStrategy made significant Bitcoin investments. El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, followed by Cuba. NFTs surged in popularity, offering a new avenue for digital art and collectibles.

<br><br>
### Crypto Winter and Market Turmoil
**2022:** The market faced another crash, with the total cap dropping to $800 billion and Bitcoin and Ethereum losing up to 75% of their value. Major collapses, including Terra/Luna and FTX, revealed vulnerabilities in the ecosystem. Regulatory pressures intensified amid rising scams and bankruptcies, exacerbated by the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes.

<br><br>
### Recovery and Innovation
**2023-Present:** The cryptocurrency market began stabilizing and recovering from the 2022 downturn. Innovations emphasized eco-friendly mining practices and wider adoption across industries like healthcare and real estate. The market’s projected annual growth rate suggests revenues may reach $71.7 billion by 2028, signaling a more mature and regulated phase for cryptocurrency.
