### Traditional Finance

Traditional Finance (TradFi) is a “mainstream financial system and the conventional institutions such as retail, investment, and commercial banks, insurance companies, brokerages, and other regulated entities that operate	within it.” (Willing, 2024). The traditional financial system follows a centralized structure, making it a source of trust to develop and market financial products and services. Managing risks is also one of their duties by regulating financial markets and providing insurance. There are also strict regulations that traditional finance must comply with, including the KYC or know-your-customer regulations. It is used to verify users’ identities, which is beneficial in knowing that funds remain safe.

Traditional finance systems are still widely used worldwide and are rooted in the various services they provide to the public. However, there are trends where the public tends to find other channels and systems aside from TradFi because of issues they have faced throughout the years, such as little to no access.  Traditional financial intermediaries are one issue that urges some users to look for alternatives. If they want to manage their finances independently and provide greater control over financial decisions, TradFi is not for them. Extensive documentation in traditional financial systems is also an obstacle because it is more time-consuming compared to others that are more direct. Another example of an alternative that people are currently seeking to overcome traditional financial constraints is decentralized finance with cryptocurrency-based services–or just the cryptocurrency systems alone.

### Cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrency is a form of virtual or digital currency that uses cryptography techniques to protect transactions and stop counterfeiting. Cryptocurrencies run on decentralized blockchain networks, which allow for safe, open, and independent transactions in contrast to conventional fiat currencies that are governed by central banks. The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which was created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto and used blockchain technology—a distributed record that is impenetrable to tampering—to solve the problem of double-spending. The cryptocurrency ecosystem has now grown dramatically, incorporating a wide range of assets and uses, including smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi) (Willing, 2024).

Cryptocurrencies differ significantly from conventional financial systems in that they are decentralized. Cryptocurrencies enable cross-border peer-to-peer transactions and give consumers financial sovereignty by doing away with middlemen like banks and governments. This has made cryptocurrencies especially helpful in areas where fiat currencies are unstable or banking is scarce. Moreover, developments like DeFi are using blockchain technology to build open financial ecosystems that provide trading, lending, and borrowing capabilities without requiring centralized institutions. But there are drawbacks to these developments as well, such as unclear regulations and the possibility of abuse in criminal matters (Willing, 2024).

### Blockchain 

Blockchain technology, a decentralized, impenetrable ledger, is enabling cryptocurrency to transform established banking systems. Blockchain ensures transparency, immutability, and security while facilitating direct peer-to-peer transactions, in contrast to centralized financial institutions that depend on middlemen. Blockchain's decentralized structure, which was first developed to facilitate digital currencies like Bitcoin, verifies transactions without the need for a central authority. This technology has demonstrated its disruptive potential by extending its reach beyond banking and influencing industries including supply chain management and healthcare (Huffman, 2024).
