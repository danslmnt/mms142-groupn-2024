### Pump and Dump Scheme:

This scheme is a type of market manipulation, wherein scammers make coordinated efforts to “pump” or inflate the price of a cryptocurrency by spreading false and exaggerated positive information to create a buying frenzy amongst unsuspecting users. The scammers would then sell or “dump” their own shares at the inflated price, causing the targeted cryptocurrency to plummet in value, leaving new investors with substantial losses to their investments.
