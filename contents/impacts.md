### Environmental Impact 

Cryptocurrency's use and influence have grown rapidly; nevertheless this has raised considerable environmental concerns. Mining operations and its energy demands and reliance on various energy sources have come under intense scrutiny. Understanding the environmental consequences of cryptocurrency mining necessitates an examination of the overall energy landscape and its associated issues.

The biggest issue with Bitcoin mining is its immense energy consumption, as indicated by the global energy use associated with mining activities. Many mining facilities operate in high-carbon areas. This issue is related to larger social concerns, such as the availability of energy resources in certain locations and the local environmental consequences of excessive energy consumption. Bitcoin mining's massive carbon footprint is viewed as an enormous challenge for a business under scrutiny due to its global economic impact. This influence is driven by two major factors. First, miners encounter high electricity expenses, as they use energy-intensive machinery to solve complex algorithms, leading to significant carbon emissions. Second, the operations generate enormous e-waste because of the rapid degradation of mining equipment (Hossain & Steigner, 2024).

Winotoatmojo et al., (2024) reflect on the UN scientists' claim that Bitcoin mining relies primarily on fossil fuel sources, with coal accounting for 45% of Bitcoin's energy supply mix, followed by natural gas (21%). Hydropower, a renewable energy source with major water and environmental consequences, is the most important renewable energy source for the Bitcoin mining network, accounting for 16% of total electricity demand. Nuclear energy contributes a significant 9% of Bitcoin's energy supply distribution, whereas renewables such as solar and wind account for only 2% and 5%, respectively, of total energy made use by Bitcoin.

Cryptocurrency's longevity is influenced by a variety of environmental, economic, social, and ideological aspects. Furthermore, this currency, like many other economically exploited items for potential advantages, is often viewed in terms of future generations' impact on the environment. The environmental concerns around cryptocurrency mining indicate the need for sustainable methods and innovative energy solutions. Addressing these concerns is crucial to establishing a balance between technological advancement and long-term environmental effects.

### Economic Impact 

Cryptocurrency remains a rapidly evolving and multifaceted technology, making it challenging to fully grasp its complete impact on the global economy. Nevertheless, its influence is evident across various economic sectors, reshaping financial systems, creating new opportunities, and raising various  critical challenges.

__Decentralization:__ Cryptocurrency predominantly operates on peer-to-peer transactions, placing power directly in the hands of the user and removing the presence of intermediaries or ‘middlemen’ such as banks or government entities. Decentralized finance platforms have emerged to offer lending and trading services without the help of traditional banks, which has sparked conversations on the possible diminishing of financial institutions should cryptocurrency be fully adopted.

__Diverse Involvement:__ Cryptocurrency platforms require only a digital wallet and an internet connection, which allows them to be more accessible to the general public than traditional banking. This asset is particularly valuable to people who are unbanked and often excluded due to insufficient funds, lack of identification, or poor financial infrastructure in their areas. 

__High Market Volatility:__ Cryptocurrencies are notorious for their extreme price fluctuations, significantly influencing market dynamics and even inflation rates. According to Hemendra Gupta and Rashmi Chaudhary (2022) in their paper An _Empirical Study of Volatility in Cryptocurrency Market_, its dramatic price swings are highly influenced by news events, market rumors, and social media trends, heightened by a general lack of consistent global regulation.

__Broad Investment Opportunities:__ Because of its decentralized nature and high market volatility, the likelihood of high return uniquely attracts investors to cryptocurrency. Sukumaran et al. (2022) explore the logic behind the rise in crypto investments, identifying characteristics like daily accessibility and low correlation with traditional assets as key factors attracting investors  which are said to be “characteristics that have major diversification advantages.”

__Cross-Border Transactions:__ Unlike traditional services that involve high costs due to currency exchange rates, cryptocurrencies provide more cost-effective international transfers. With blockchain technology, it also removes the common delays caused by intermediaries and banking hours. Furthermore, Uyduran (2020) notes that cryptocurrencies also reduce political risks that are associated with cross-border transactions, making it less susceptible to fluctuations caused by geopolitical climates.

__Creation of New (and Possible Depletion of Old) Economies:__ Cryptocurrencies have enabled the development and growth of new digital economies, such as non-fungible token or NFT-based content creation, play-to-earn gaming, and the aforementioned decentralized finance system. From these newly developed industries came new job opportunities, like in mining and blockchain development. However, in the case of the complete adoption of cryptocurrency, this would also lead to the possible decline of traditional financial institutions and the loss of hundreds of jobs.

### Social/Ethical Impact

Cryptocurrency has rapidly been adapted and recognized as a modern financial system by various institutions, whether on a smaller scale or a broader one. However, its existence is accompanied by several dilemmas and challenges concerning its social and behavioral impacts on users.

As stated by Delfabbro et al. (2021a), the volatile nature of cryptocurrency promotes high-risk behaviors among users, such as problematic gambling. Due to its highly unpredictable asset values, its information is determined to be limited. As a result, this motivates traders to engage in financial speculations in which they chase the expectation of uncertain yet potentially high gains. This behavior in cryptocurrency trading mirrors patterns observed in stock market trading, which are associated with problem gambling, where stakes are placed on unclear outcomes largely influenced by chance (Delfabbro et al., 2021b). 

Such behaviors become the root for financial problems, ranging from incrementing losses such as diminishing savings, borrowing money, to major harms like bankruptcy, homelessness and the loss of all valuable possessions (Browne et al., 2017). Delfabbro (2021) also stated that recognizing digital money as an income-generator also makes problematic gamblers become more addicted to cryptocurrency because of fear of missing out, as well as anticipated regret for missing chances of achieving financial stability, regardless of certainty.

In these circumstances, the negative impact of problem gambling is not only static to the individual, but also extends to the workforce. For instance, the study of Latvala et al. (2019) states that gambling during work results in absenteeism, productivity losses, impaired working relationships and employment termination (Latvala et al., 2019). Moreover, work performance also declines due to tiredness or distraction. It is important to recognize that the condition of work performance leads to long- and short- term effects on both the individual and its family.

The financial system of cryptocurrency is also vulnerable to exploitation for facilitating criminal activities (Kethineni and Cao, 2020). In extreme cases, cryptocurrency also becomes a tool of fraudulent attempts to scam users out of their financial investments in the form of crypto services and projects. Some illegal activities associated with cryptocurrency are money laundering, tax evasion, Ponzi schemes and kidnapping for ransom. For instance, “Silk Road”, the first well-known online marketplace and a form of payment on Bitcoin was used as a form of payment, for buying and selling illicit items such as narcotics and forged passports (Popper, 2015). Along with it, unregulated gambling was also present in other early platforms adopting Bitcoin payments, such as SatoshiDice.

Furthermore, cryptic systems are also found to increase existent inequalities (Chohan, 2022).  Due to the unsustainable trajectory of some cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency producers are likely to take advantage of economic instabilities, weak regulations, and access to cheap energy and other resources, making poor and vulnerable communities subject to even deeper risks, which includes both the burden of economic  and environmental costs of crypto, as well as the possibilities of community instabilities (Howson & de Vries, 2022).
