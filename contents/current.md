### Bitcoin vs. Other Cryptocurrencies

Many have seen the news headlines of Bitcoin being at an all-time high after the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election and wonder why that is so. First off, it’s good to clarify that Bitcoin is just one of the tens of thousands of cryptocurrencies available worldwide. The main reason why we see “Bitcoin” in the headlines is because it is the most familiar one since it was the very first cryptocurrency that was created in 2009. Aside from that, Bitcoin currently has the largest market share in the cryptocurrency market at over 50% and its value nearing $100,000.

### Global Cryptocurrency Adoption and Social Media Influence

The global ownership of cryptocurrency has surged to 6.8%, with over 560 million users worldwide—an impressive 23% increase from 2023. This growth is driven by the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, their convenience in digital transactions, and the influence of social media. Platforms like X (formerly Twitter) have played a significant role in attracting new investors, particularly during notable events such as the Bitcoin Halving in April 2024. This event halved the amount of new Bitcoin entering circulation, increasing scarcity and driving up prices. Discussions and market predictions shared widely on social media created a buzz, drawing in both seasoned traders and beginners eager to capitalize on the anticipated market movements.

### Regulatory Changes Supporting Crypto Growth

Regulatory advancements have also contributed to the expanding cryptocurrency market. The Travel Rule, extended to include crypto transactions, mandates institutions to collect and share information about senders and receivers to prevent money laundering and financial terrorism. Additionally, the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation has established a comprehensive framework for defining crypto-assets and ensuring transparency and consumer protection. These measures have bolstered trust and accessibility, encouraging greater adoption while serving as models for global regulation.

### Common Schemes and Scams in Cryptocurrency

Despite these advancements, the crypto space remains vulnerable to scams and fraudulent schemes. As of November 2024, an estimated $1.2 billion has been lost to cryptocurrency-related scams, underscoring the need for vigilance. Common scams include pump-and-dump schemes, where scammers artificially inflate a cryptocurrency’s price before selling off their holdings, causing the value to crash. Rug pull scams involve creating fake crypto projects, soliciting investments, and abandoning the project after liquidating holdings. Fake crypto exchanges and wallets lure users with promises of low fees and secure storage but ultimately steal private keys and assets. Additionally, giveaway scams on social media exploit users by promising rewards in exchange for sensitive information, only to disappear after securing their funds.

### Trump’s Disapproval of Current Crypto Regulators

With that being said, we can dive into why cryptocurrency is on the rise after the election. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has stated that once he takes office, he plans to remove the U.S.’s Security and Exchange Commission (government agency that oversees financial markets) Chairman Gary Gensler from his position. The problem, however, is that a President doesn’t actually have the authority to directly fire him, but can only appoint a new Chairman while Gensler would remain a commissioner in the agency. Gensler, however, ahead of time has announced this month that he will be stepping down from the SEC.
