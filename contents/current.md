### Bitcoin vs. Other Cryptocurrencies

Many have seen the news headlines of Bitcoin being at an all-time high after the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election and wonder why that is so. First off, it’s good to clarify that Bitcoin is just one of the tens of thousands of cryptocurrencies available worldwide. The main reason why we see “Bitcoin” in the headlines is because it is the most familiar one since it was the very first cryptocurrency that was created in 2009. Aside from that, Bitcoin currently has the largest market share in the cryptocurrency market at over 50% and its value nearing $100,000.

The problem, however, is that a President doesn’t actually have the authority to directly fire him, but can only appoint a new Chairman while Gensler would remain a commissioner in the agency.
