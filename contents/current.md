### Bitcoin vs. Other Cryptocurrencies

Many have seen the news headlines of Bitcoin being at an all-time high after the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election and wonder why that is so. First off, it’s good to clarify that Bitcoin is just one of the tens of thousands of cryptocurrencies available worldwide. The main reason why we see “Bitcoin” in the headlines is because it is the most familiar one since it was the very first cryptocurrency that was created in 2009. Aside from that, Bitcoin currently has the largest market share in the cryptocurrency market at over 50% and its value nearing $100,000.

### Global Cryptocurrency Adoption and Social Media Influence

The global ownership of cryptocurrency has surged to 6.8%, with over 560 million users worldwide—an impressive 23% increase from 2023. This growth is driven by the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, their convenience in digital transactions, and the influence of social media. Platforms like X (formerly Twitter) have played a significant role in attracting new investors, particularly during notable events such as the Bitcoin Halving in April 2024. This event halved the amount of new Bitcoin entering circulation, increasing scarcity and driving up prices. Discussions and market predictions shared widely on social media created a buzz, drawing in both seasoned traders and beginners eager to capitalize on the anticipated market movements.

### Regulatory Changes Supporting Crypto Growth

Regulatory advancements have also contributed to the expanding cryptocurrency market. The Travel Rule, extended to include crypto transactions, mandates institutions to collect and share information about senders and receivers to prevent money laundering and financial terrorism. Additionally, the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation has established a comprehensive framework for defining crypto-assets and ensuring transparency and consumer protection. These measures have bolstered trust and accessibility, encouraging greater adoption while serving as models for global regulation.

### Common Schemes and Scams in Cryptocurrency

Despite these advancements, the crypto space remains vulnerable to scams and fraudulent schemes. As of November 2024, an estimated $1.2 billion has been lost to cryptocurrency-related scams, underscoring the need for vigilance. Common scams include pump-and-dump schemes, where scammers artificially inflate a cryptocurrency’s price before selling off their holdings, causing the value to crash. Rug pull scams involve creating fake crypto projects, soliciting investments, and abandoning the project after liquidating holdings. Fake crypto exchanges and wallets lure users with promises of low fees and secure storage but ultimately steal private keys and assets. Additionally, giveaway scams on social media exploit users by promising rewards in exchange for sensitive information, only to disappear after securing their funds.

### Trump’s Disapproval of Current Crypto Regulators

With that being said, we can dive into why cryptocurrency is on the rise after the election. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has stated that once he takes office, he plans to remove the U.S.’s Security and Exchange Commission (government agency that oversees financial markets) Chairman Gary Gensler from his position. The problem, however, is that a President doesn’t actually have the authority to directly fire him, but can only appoint a new Chairman while Gensler would remain a commissioner in the agency. Gensler, however, ahead of time has announced this month that he will be stepping down from the SEC.

### Crypto Industry’s Distrust in the Current Crypto Regulators

Those in the space are not big fans of Gensler because they feel he has not been clear on regulation over cryptocurrency. When regulation is unclear, founders worry that they might not be operating legally. These fears have been proven valid due to the SEC taking legal action against over 100 cryptocurrency companies and projects during his time as the Chairman of the SEC. These could have been avoided if they had clarity in the first place on what guidelines to follow. 

The co-founder & CEO of Coinbase, one of the most prominent crypto exchange platforms in the world, posted on X (formerly Twitter) on October 29, 2024 an image of the SEC’s conflicting statements on what their true stance on cryptocurrency is, whether or not digital assets are classified as securities. This is significant, because if digital assets are not classified as securities, then the SEC has no jurisdiction over it, and cryptocurrency owners have full autonomy over their own assets.  

Under Gensler’s leadership, the X account of the SEC posted that the SEC had approved of a certain type of Bitcoin investment, and they later posted that their account was hacked. This led to a further lack of trust in the SEC from the crypto industry. The disapproval of Gensler’s leadership has led 18 U.S. states to sue him for “regulatory overreach” as was reported just 10 days ago on November 14. 

The leaders of these 18 states believe Gensler and the SEC have gone too far in their efforts to regulate the crypto industry, accusing them of abusing their power and imposing rules or actions that exceed what they are legally allowed to do. They argue that his aggressive approach is unfair, unclear, and harmful to businesses in the crypto industry.

### Trump’s Plans for the Future of Crypto 

With Gensler stepping down and Trump being supportive of crypto in general, it’s no wonder that crypto investments rapidly rose and continue to do so since Election Day. 

Trump himself reportedly has $250,000 to $500,000 worth of digital assets in a cryptocurrency wallet. He is working on establishing a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” once he takes office, with a pro-crypto council. Reportedly, many of the leaders in the crypto industry are aiming to get a seat on the council.

Funny enough, he used to be against it, famously posting on Twitter back in 2019 that “I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity....”

However, he has had a change of heart and has stated his intentions to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet” when he attended a Bitcoin conference earlier this year while campaigning for the election. He believes that Americans should have the freedom to have digital assets without government surveillance and control, opposite from how CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies) operate.

From an economic perspective, he aims for all Bitcoin to be mined within the United States, which will create new jobs for its citizens. Bitcoin mining as defined by Coinbase is “the process that Bitcoin and several other cryptocurrencies use to generate new coins and verify new transactions. It involves vast, decentralized networks of computers around the world that verify and secure blockchains – the virtual ledgers that document cryptocurrency transactions. In return for contributing their processing power, computers on the network are rewarded with new coins.”

Despite all of the above, it is important to know, however, that Trump has made it clear that “We will have regulations, but from now on the rules will be written by people who love your industry, not hate your industry,” which is important because many of the US’s choices in regulating finance and trade have a significant impact on other countries and the world economy. Therefore, we are at an interesting time observing how the US’s regulatory approach will influence other countries to regulate their own citizens’ digital asset behaviors.
